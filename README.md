In these times of digitalization, all major organizations are aiming to automate most of their processes for better convenience. One important task for an organization involves filing of expenses by employees for claiming reimbursements. These expenses also need to be approved/rejected by the appropriate authority.

A web application based on **react-redux** at frontend, and **Java** and **PostgreSQL** at backend has been built to provide an automated solution to record and
report business expenses.

This repository includes all the codes which the website uses. The website can be accessed at https://expense-management-system-rs.herokuapp.com/.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
