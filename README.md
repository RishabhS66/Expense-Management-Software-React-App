In these times of digitalization, all major organizations are aiming to automate most of their processes for better convenience. One important task for an organization involves filing of expenses by employees for claiming reimbursements. These expenses also need to be approved / rejected by the appropriate authority.

A web application based on **react-redux** at frontend, and **Java** and **PostgreSQL** at backend has been built to provide an automated solution to record and
report business expenses.

This repository includes all the codes which the [Expense Management System](https://expense-management-system-rs.herokuapp.com/) website uses.

## Features
<ul type="square">
  <li> Login for employees (with JWT Auth Token)

  <li> View project and expense summaries
  <li> Approval tab for approving / rejecting expense claims
  <li> Feature to change password when the user wants.
</ul>

## Note
The **backend code** for this project can be accessed at this [repo](https://github.com/RishabhS66/Expense-Management-Software-Backend).<br>
Both the frontend and backend components of the project have been hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). <br>
